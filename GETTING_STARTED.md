## 🎓 Key Concepts Cheat Sheet

### React
- **Component** = Reusable UI piece
- **Props** = Data passed to component
- **State** = Data that can change
- **useState** = Hook to manage state
- **useEffect** = Hook to run code on load/update

### Spring Boot
- **@RestController** = Creates API endpoint
- **@Service** = Business logic layer
- **@Autowired** = Dependency injection
- **GET/POST** = HTTP methods
- **JSON** = Data format

### APIs
- **REST** = API design style
- **Endpoint** = URL path (e.g., `/api/chat`)
- **Request** = What you send
- **Response** = What you receive
- **CORS** = Cross-origin security

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know everything before starting?**  
A: No! Learn as you build. The code has detailed comments.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Read error messages, check console logs, review the code comments.

**Q: Can I modify the project?**  
A: Yes! Experimenting is the best way to learn.

**Q: What if I don't understand something?**  
A: That's normal! Read the code comments, try modifying it, check documentation.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: Depends on your pace. Aim for 2-3 hours per day for 4-5 days.
